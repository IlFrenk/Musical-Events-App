# Musical Events

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application.

This is an app that makes you browse all the musical stored in our database.  
You can add/delete them as a provider, or book them as a user.  
  
Please take a look at the [Client](https://github.com/IlFrenk/Musical-Events-Client-App) for a complete understanding of this project.
